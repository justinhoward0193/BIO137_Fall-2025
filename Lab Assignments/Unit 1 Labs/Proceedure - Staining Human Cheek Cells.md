# Procedure - Staining Human Cheek Cells

**Course:** Human Anatomy & Physiology I (BIO 137)  
**Related background:** [[Background - Staining Human Cheek Cells]]
**Topic:** Microscopy & Cell Observation  
**Stain:** Methylene Blue  

---

## Purpose
To prepare a wet mount slide of human epithelial cells from the inside of the cheek, stain them with methylene blue, and observe cellular structures under the microscope.  

---

## Materials
- Microscope slide and coverslip  
- Sterile toothpick or cotton swab  
- Distilled water (dropper bottle)  
- Methylene blue solution (0.1–1%)  
- Paper towels or bibulous paper  
- Compound light microscope

## Procedure
1. **Collect sample** – gently scrape inside of cheek with sterile toothpick/cotton swab.  
2. **Transfer** – smear onto clean slide.  
3. **Add water** – 1 small drop of distilled water.  
4. **Apply stain** – add 1 drop methylene blue.  
5. **Air dry briefly** – let sit 1–2 minutes.  
6. **Add coverslip** – lower at 45° angle to avoid bubbles.  
7. **Blot excess** – with paper towel if needed.  
8. **Observe** – begin at low power (10x), move to higher magnification.

## Observations
Look for:  
- **Cell membrane** outlining the cell  
- **Cytoplasm** filling the interior  
- **Nucleus** stained dark blue  

---

## Safety Notes
- Handle methylene blue with care.  
- Dispose of slides in sharps container.  
- Wash hands after lab.  

---

## Post-Lab Questions
1. Which structures were most easily visible after staining?  
2. Why does methylene blue make cheek cells easier to study?
