# Background - Staining Human Cheek Cells

## Introduction
The human body is composed of trillions of cells. One of the simplest ways to visualize a living human cell is by collecting epithelial cells from the inside of the cheek. These cells are easily obtained, safe to handle, and represent typical features of eukaryotic animal cells.

## Epithelial Cells
- **Definition:** Epithelial cells line surfaces and cavities of the body, including skin, glands, and mucous membranes.  
- **Function in the cheek:** They protect the underlying tissue and provide a barrier against microbes and mechanical stress.  
- **Appearance under the microscope:** Thin, flat, and irregularly shaped with a prominent nucleus.

## Methylene Blue Stain
- **Why stain?** Most cells are nearly transparent under a light microscope, making it hard to see structures.  
- **How it works:** Methylene blue is a basic dye that binds to negatively charged molecules such as DNA and RNA.  
- **Result:** The nucleus appears dark blue, while the cytoplasm is faintly stained.

## Microscopy Concepts
- **Magnification:** Compound microscopes use a combination of ocular (10x) and objective lenses (e.g., 10x, 40x, 100x) to enlarge the image.  
- **Resolution:** The ability to distinguish two close objects as separate. Stains improve contrast, which helps resolution.  
- **Wet mount technique:** Keeps cells hydrated and close to their natural state.

## Comparison: Animal vs. Plant Cells
- **Animal (cheek) cells:** No cell wall, no chloroplasts, irregular shape, nucleus visible with stain.  
- **Plant (onion epidermis) cells:** Cell wall, large central vacuole, rectangular shape, chloroplasts in photosynthetic tissues.

## Key Concepts
1. **Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Cells:** Human cheek cells are eukaryotic, meaning they have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.  
2. **Nucleus as Control Center:** The dark-stained nucleus contains DNA, which regulates cell activities.  
3. **Microscopy in Anatomy & Physiology:** Observing cells is foundational for understanding tissues, organs, and systems in the human body.

## Review Questions
1. Why are cheek cells classified as epithelial cells?  
2. What role does methylene blue play in this lab?
